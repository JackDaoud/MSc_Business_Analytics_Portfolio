# SQL Advertising Management Platform
Final Team Project conducted with [Jack Daoud](https://github.com/JackDaoud) as a part of the Data Management & SQL class. 

## Files & Task
The task of this project was the creation of an advertising management platform for an external client. We, the consultants, were tasked with developing a high-level use-case, identifying current shortcomings in database solutions and solving key pain-points of the organization. 

### 1) Database 
Database with dummy data. This file contains the database (advertising management platform) we created. This database was filled with dummy data that does not reflect any real information (see disclaimer below).  

File: [ad_mgmt_v4.sql](https://github.com/maxlembke/SQL_Advertising_Management_Platform/blob/main/ad_mgmt_v4.sql)

### 2) Queries 
Collection of queries and "commented-out" stored procedures that were designed for use with the database.

File: [all_queries](https://github.com/maxlembke/SQL_Advertising_Management_Platform/blob/main/all_queries.sql)

### 3) Report 
Written report on the database created. This contains an examination of key business problems, the proposed solution, scope & limitations.
