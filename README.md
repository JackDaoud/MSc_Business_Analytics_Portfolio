Capstone Project of a MSc. in Business Analytics. 

Apprentice Chef is a hypothetical company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Executives at Apprentice Chef are interested in predicting: 
- How much revenue they could expect from each customer within their first year of using Apprentice Chef services
- Which customers will subscribe to the *"Halfway There"* service, a cross-selling promotion
