This was my team's submission to the first ever Hackathon organized by the Hult Data Analytic's Club from the Boston campus (Apr 30<sup>th</sup> - May 2<sup>nd</sup> 2021). We were asked to build a **Neural Network model from scratch using NumPy**. Our goal was to classify images from [Zalandoe's Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

We spent the weekend researching, buidling, and optimizing a variety of neural networks. Our winning neural network model used two layers with coefficients and biases corrected using back propagation. We tried other models using dropouts and normalization of data, but they did not yield better test accruacy. Our submitted model yielded 0.817 accuracy on the test data. When the judges tested our model against their private test data set, our model yielded 0.2404 accuracy - the highest accuracy from all submitted models.
