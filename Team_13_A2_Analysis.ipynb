    "Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.\n",

    "Explained variance: <b>0.365</b>. Their effectiveness (Conscientiousness: <b>-0.54</b>) ensures teams achieve their targets. They are people-oriented but can get irritated (Extraversion: <b>-0.32</b>, Neuroticism: <b>0.32</b>). \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "They are organised and have a clear workspace. Instead of extras, they value easy and intuitive interfaces that allow managing numerous tasks. Though their <i>Conscientiousness</i> (<b>-0.54</b>) leads them towards Windows Laptops (Nevid & Pastva, 2014), their explicit <i>Openness</i> (<b>-0.51</b>) makes them accepting of the idea of switching. Handleability and user interface can convert them.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To support them, Apple must show its cleaner interface and benefits, e.g. trackpad-actions.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Explained variance: <b>0.19</b>. They are the social heart of the team and have connections to people outside the team.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "They use tech to stay in touch with their connections; brands do not matter. Their Neuroticism (<b>0.57</b>) values costs and discards ease-of-use, making them a Windows customer. Yet, low Conscientiousness (<b>-0.37</b>) is associated with non-Windows (Nevid & Pastva, 2014).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To support them, we must ensure an easy and seamless transfer of all data-types.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Emotional stability and confidence (Neuroticism: <b>0.71</b>) means they do not chase after trends. Their low neuroticism puts ease-of-use above cost avoidance (Nevid & Pastva, 2014).<br>\n",

    "Explained variance: <b>0.654</b>. Their Thinking factor loading (<b>-0.53</b>) leads them to continuously explore, learn, and chase growth-opportunities that can help them to improve their skill-set and knowledge. Their innovative ideas and work are always of high-quality. As direct communicators, they accept their weaknesses and strengths and strive to be better, hence continuously asking for feedback (Communication: <b>-0.41</b>). Individuals exhibiting a Growth Mindset are cooperative and put the teams' needs before their own. In situations of conflict they hence know to mediate and reach a compromise (Team Building: <b>-0.50</b>, Leadership: <b>-0.50</b>).<br>\n",
    "As they express their personality through their work, they value design and a highly stylized art reflects this personality. To support them, Apple should clearly show their meticulous attention to detail in every small feature, and continue offering their iconic aesthetics in hardware, software, and all features that will allow the Growth Mindset persona to create and accomplish their daily tasks with ease.\n",

    "<b><i>Growth Mindset</i> people make up 31.40%.</b>\n",

    "<h4>The Follower</h4>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Explain a variance: <b>0.174</b>. They are incredibly extroverted and outgoing (Communication: <b>0.82</b>) and hence successfully communicate others ideas in an inspirational and convincing manner. However, they lack creativity and dynamic thinking of their own (Thinking: <b>-0.24</b>). It is easier for them to follow and take the pre-made opinion and recommendation as their own. Because they focus on what they can achieve individually, they do not excel in leading and building strong teams. (Leadership: <b>-0.49</b>, Team Building: <b>0.07</b>). They furthermore do not appreciate feedback as they are too busy trying to prove their competencies rather than learning from others.\n",
    "They value customisable features over ease-of-use. To support them, Apple must emphasize their compatibility with many other accessories and softwares that enable users to customize and explore on their own.\n",

    "There are undoubtedly many components that determine a consumer's choice of a particular computer brand. Though Windows and Mac users were not directly distinguishable in regards to the Big Five personality traits or Hult DNA in our analysis, the traits of their personalities did link with the different weights customers place on different attributes of laptops. For instance, people with higher Growth Mindset levels placed more importance on ease-of-use and style and less so on cost. Conversely, the Networkers neurotic tendencies placed a higher importance on costs and less so on the ease-of-use, which actually makes them a suitable Windows customer.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Moreover, the present study showed that people who currently own a MacBook are brand loyal and do not consider changing their computer brand of choice in the future. By contrast, Windows users did demonstrate the willingness to switch from Windows to MacBook in future purchases. For Apple to achieve that they need to be able to connect and target accordingly; by knowing their audience and talking to them in their language in a way that makes them feel aligned with Apple's values, these customers can be converted.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "From the analysis below, we believe that Apple should focus on targeting the <b>Risk-Takers</b> segment, which comprises <b>XX%</b> of the relevant target population. Apple should focus on this cluster because they are the change-makers of tomorrow, the leaders that stand out and are capable of transmitting Apple’s values and aligning to Apple’s brand identity. If targeted appropriately, these can and will become loyal customers possibly even convincing others via word-of-mouth recommendations.<br>\n",
    "Currently, the typical Risk-Taker owns a Windows laptop and are already thinking of switching to the Apple MacBook. These are usually highly educated millennials, people in their 20's, who are career-oriented, pursuing a dual degree master's in Business Analytics, Male, and are of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Since these people tend to have a growth mindset, they will be looking for products that can support quick and sudden change, handle different situations, and be very agile.\n",
    "All this speaks to providing the Risk-Takers segment with many facts and side-by-side comparisons, showing Apple's superiority. This cluster needs to be convinced not by a glossy image but rather by matter-of-factly statement. To win over this cluster, we should offer informational resources and make ourselves readily available for question sessions.<br>\n",
    "With these resources at hand, the Risk-Takers are sure to choose Apple for their next laptop.\n",

    "- Total of **137 survey respondents** (observations)\n",
    "- Total of 79 survey questions (variables)\n",
    "- **Big 5 data** had **50 survey questions**, 10 for each one of the five personality traits.\n",
    "- **Hult DNA data** had **22 survey questions**, each of which belong to one of the three traits. We found that some questions should be categorized in a new trait of the Hult DNA which we called Leadership.\n",
    "- **Demographics data** had **7 survey questions** pertaining to gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, current program enrolled in Hult IBS, current laptop, and future laptop considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wrangling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropped Hult DNA duplicate questions \n",
    "- Renamed Big 5 questions to match their respective traits\n",
    "- Renamed demographic survey questions with the respective demographic element\n",
    "- **Engineered** demographic variables `Age Range` & `Region` from `Age` and `Nationality` respectively\n",
    "- **Identified invalid survey responses** using Big 5 reversal questions:\n",
    "    - These are questions are literal opposites of other questions. Where one question's rating would add to a trait, the reversal questions would remove from the trait.\n",
    "    - **Heuristic used**: \n",
    "        - Flag any respondent who answered identical answers on opposite questions\n",
    "        - Ignore respondents who answered with 3 which denotes Neutral\n",
    "        - Sum the flag and look for a natural cut-off point\n",
    "        - Drop all respondents with flags past that cut-off point\n",
    "    - A total of *16 invalid responses were identified and dropped*\n",
    "- **Adjusted scores** for the Hult DNA & Big 5 questions:\n",
    "    - Neutral scores received a 0\n",
    "    - Positive scores received a 1 or 2\n",
    "    - Negative scores received a -1 or -2\n",
    "    - Positive and negative depends on the polarity of the question itself\n",
    "- **Aggregated** the adjusted scores of the 70 or so questions were aggregated to a **total 9 behavioral traits**. 5 from the OCEAN model, 3 come from the Hult DNA, and the last 1 is the innovated trait of Leadership that is at the center of the Hult DNA.\n",
